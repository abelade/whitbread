# Whitbread Foursquare app

This project is an example using the foursquare API to get popular places.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the whitbread repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the whitbread repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test whitbread. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/abelade/whitbread.git
cd whitbread
```

If you just want to start a new project without the whitbread commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/abelade/whitbread.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.



## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  components/           --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```

## Testing

The test script is right inside the app.js file to make it easier to use.  This still needs some specific modifications to check everything.

## Notes

The bower_components folder and Components folder has some un-needed files. If I had enough time, I would make this example production ready, by adjusting the dependencies accordingly.
